    Title: 'Alvin Kamara Returning To Practice',
    Content:
      "New Orleans Saints running back Alvin  Kamara is expected to return to practice on Wednesday while long-term contract negotiations with the team continue. Kamara told NFL Network's Ian Rapoport that he didn't make any trade demands, but he has had some unexcused absences from training camp. He's expected to be fined $200,000 ($15,000 for each day missed). As of late Tuesday night, cooler heads prevailed and the two sides are expected to get back to the negotiating table with the season approaching. The gap in negotiations isn't that big, so the expectation is that Kamara will stick around in New Orleans long term. The 25-year-old has more touchdowns and yards per rush than Christian  McCaffrey, the consensus No. 1 overall fantasy pick. Kamara is easily a top-five fantasy target in the first round of drafts.",

    Title: 'Joe Mixon, Bengals Agree Upon Four-Year Extension',
    Content:
      "The Cincinnati Bengals and running back Joe  Mixon are reportedly finalizing a four-year contract extension that will keep him with the team through the 2024 season. Mixon had been angling for a new contract throughout the offseason and even threatened to hold out if he didn't get a new deal with the team. Now he can prepare to slide back in as the team's bell-cow back in what should be a much-improved Cincinnati offense. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reports that the deal will be for $48 million. Mixon has been sidelined at practice over the past week but that issue doesn't threaten to keep him out of action long-term. The talented running back is safe to draft towards the end of the first round in fantasy drafts this weekend.",

    Content:
      "The Jacksonville Jaguars have released running back Leonard  Fournette, who was entering his final year under contract with the team. His high workload as a Jag made him a safe fantasy RB2 with upside as long as he was playing in Jacksonville, but now everything's up in the air. Will Fournette find a new home this close to the season that will give him the usage he needs to be fantasy relevant? Obviously, he tumbles down draft boards now and is more of a dart throw in the later rounds. As for Jacksonville, Ryquell  Armstead likely steps into a bigger role and has low-end RB2 upside now, though Chris  Thompson will siphon off some of Armstead's passing down usage. Thompson is an interesting late pick in full-PPR leagues.",

Ryan spent the past four years with the Tennessee Titans and intercepted four passes in 2019. He's reportedly seeking around $10 million a year, which is one of the reasons why he's still unsigned. Cleveland.com reports that if he were to decrease his salary expectations, the Browns could finalize a deal with him soon.",

The Cowboys reported they were simply managing reps for the veteran receiver ahead of Sunday's intrasquad scrimmage.The veteran receiver has more competition for targets after the team used a first-round pick on CeeDee  Lamb, but Cooper is still the number-one wide receiver in this offense and could benefit as he'll have more opportunities to line up in the slot. Cooper should still see close to the 119 targets he received last season in an offense that had the second-most pass yards in the NFL. Cooper is a WR1 who should be drafted with a top-30 pick in fantasy drafts.",

    Title: 'Benny Snell Jr. Pushing For A Role On Offense',
    Content:
      'Pittsburgh Steelers running back Benny  Snell  Jr. has been impressing during training camp, according to Mark Kaboly of The Athletic. This offseason, the Steelers have been limiting the workload of starting running back James  Conner after he has dealt with a multitude of injuries over the past few years. That has opened the door for Snell to show what he can do on the field. Snell lost about 12 pounds during the offseason, which has made him quicker and more equipped to evade tacklers. A lack of speed and explosiveness was one of the main knocks on Snell coming out of the University of Kentucky last year. Kaboly believes that Snell could "sneak his way" into a role on the Pittsburgh offense, even if Conner stays healthy. This makes Snell an ideal draft target towards the end of drafts, especially for Zero RB drafters.',

Mixon was at Monday's practice, though he sat out with a minor injury, so his complete absence on Wednesday is definitely a concern. We shouldn't just assume that Mixon is holding out for a contract extension, but we shouldn't rule the possibility out either, as his contract situation has been a glaring concern for months now. Mixon's still a late first round fantasy pick due to his talent, but some fantasy managers might be scared off of him a little bit now, which is understandable.",

      'Second-year Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Andy  Isabella has made a good impression on coaches so far in training camp. Cardinals wide receivers coach David Raih said that this year, Isabella is "much more mature" and that his "game is much more fluid." Isabella was second-round pick of the Cardinals in 2019, but caught just nine passes for 189 yards and a touchdown as a rookie. This year, with the addition of DeAndre  Hopkins, it might be even harder for Isabella to find the field as he has Hopkins, Christian  Kirk and Larry  Fitzgerald ahead of him in the pecking order while he\'s also competing with KeeSean  Johnson and Hakeem  Butler. It\'s going to be hard for Isabella to make much of an impact in fantasy terms this year, but his improvement is certainly a good sign for him long term.',

The early reports in camp have indicated that Chicago\'s tight ends have been heavily involved in the offensive game plan through the first five practices. The veteran Graham signed a two-year deal after a disappointing season with Green Bay but has looked reinvigorated early on. Graham currently sits outside the top-10 rankings among tight ends in fantasy but early indications are that he could have a massive role early on in 2020. Whether Graham can return to Pro Bowl form is anyone\'s guess but the veteran is trending in the right direction.',

White has just 25 receptions for 285 yards and no touchdowns in the three seasons he played in with Chicago. In the 14 games he played over those three seasons, the 28-year-old started just five games. Gang Green could use some receiver depth in training camp, though, with both rookie Denzel Mims and Vyncint Smith injured. White would most likely just be a camp body at the receiver position.",

It's unknown how serious the injury is, but it's certainly worth keeping an eye on early in training camp, especially since Gordon admitted recently that he's had trouble getting adjusted to the altitude in Denver during practices. The Broncos signed him in free agency with the idea that he'd lead the backfield, but any missed time would pave the way for Phillip  Lindsay to see the majority of backfield touches. Unless Gordon's rib injury will cause him to miss considerable time, he's still the preferred fantasy back in Denver, but Lindsay shouldn't be forgotten.",
